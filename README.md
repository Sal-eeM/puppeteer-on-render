# Puppeteer Node Scraper for Data Crawling

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a Puppeteer-based web scraper in Node.js to extract data from the famous "Quotes to Scrape" website, which can be found at "https://quotes.toscrape.com/." Additionally, the scraper is designed to run within a Docker container for easy deployment and management. The entire application has been deployed on Render, which allows you to access the scraped data by making a single API call.
